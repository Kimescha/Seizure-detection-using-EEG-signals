# Seizure-detection-using-EEG-signals
An Undergraduate Research Done at The University of Tehran Under The Supervision of Dr. Bagher Babaali.

Used four datasets: The Epileptologie Database, UPenn and Mayo Clinic’s Seizure Detection Challenge, CHB‑MIT Scalp EEG
Database, NEDC TUH EEG Seizure corpus.

Learned about effective feature engineering in biomedical data as well as the condition of epilepsy.

Performed various machine learning and deep learning methods (based on the nature of the datasets).

Implemented supervised learning methods such as logistic regression, SVM, decision tree, and KNN.

Implemented ensemble learning, multilayer perceptron, and CNN as well.

Achieved Promising Results compared to the baseline paper.
